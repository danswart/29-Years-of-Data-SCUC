Summarizing performance by skin color, ethnicity, sex, economic level,
etc. was mandated years ago by federal law. While the drafters of the
law may have meant well, the results are amazingly destructive and
devisive.

The practice is utterly politically motivated. Among other flaws, it
presupposes that the groups are 'all alike' within the group. Ethnic
groups labeled as 'black' are no more 'all alike' than all Hispanics,
Asians, Whites or Pacific Islanders are 'all alike.'

Yet, comparing groups this way assumes all members of the groups **ARE**
all alike within the group and that the meaningful differences are
between the groups. Time and time again studies show that most
meaningful differences are within the groups, not between them.

Led by academia, it has become politically correct to seize upon any
'differences' between groups as proof positive that some kind of racism
is the cause. To propel their political agenda, activits re-label the
differences as 'disparaties', and claim that those differences reflect
actual differences in treatment of the groups by 'someone', usually the
'system.'

This practice violates statistical principles, as well as moral and
ethical principles. Accordingly, I steadfastly refuse to present data in
a manner that invites comparisons that divide us and distract us from
the fundamental goal of helping **ALL** students gain knowledge and
skills helpful for living a fruitful and happy life.
